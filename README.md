Adds spacer classes to the elemental holder on a site to allow for more CMS control over page layout
These are controlled in the CMS with an additional 'Element spacing' tab.  You may need to disable inline editing if it's not visible.

If the default ElementHolder template has been overridden, it needs to contain the '$VariantStyle' tag in order for this extension to work.


The following class names are added based on what is selected:

- bbp-padtop
- bbp-padright
- bbp-padbottom
- bbp-padleft
- bbp-margintop
- bbp-marginright
- bbp-marginbottom
- bbp-marginleft


*Note:* the add on does NOT add any CSS for these.  That should be done in the application / project styles
